A program to assist with learning other languages

This was a capstone project but I feel compelled to write about it.

So at first the project was going swimmingly. All was done in good due time.

-------------------------------------WARNING! EXPLETIVE CONTENT ------------------------------------------

Then I got to a point where, after it was going well, I had unpacked the data from the included CSV. No problem! This should be easy enough... But, wait - There's a hint here:

      To get all the words/translation rows out as a list of dictionaries e.g. [{french_word: english_word}, {french_word2: english_word2}, {french_word3: english_word3}]

Do I have to do that? I mean it seems unnecessarily complex, especially when the data is all ready and easy enough to access... But maybe the teacher wants us to flex our
problem solving skills? Maybe they think it would be too easy to just unpack the data and use as is? Alright... Not that I want to, but it seems fairly explicit so I'll take
the road less trod for now.

I did what the hint said. So now all of the keys were different to one another. So after spending a good amount of time trying to access the key of a dict in a list, I decided 
that I would simply make a list of keys to act as accessors for the Fort Knox of datastructures. This was after a python dev basically told me it was impossible to access said 
key as it was [which is what I initially tried to do.] I mean, I took it as being made deliberately complex in order to help build troubleshooting skills. But it wasn't. 
Because as soon as I had my very janky answer worked out and moved onto the 'solution for section x', the teacher did the thing THAT I WAS GOING TO DO BEFORE I READ THE DAMN
HINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

All that trying to unpack an impossible data-structure without recourse to further data structures, all the janky code, besmearing the beautiful code I had written simply in
order to fulfill the demand of unnecessary complexity - For naught! FUCK

Anyway. The real problem was that, as opposed to the cheery and upbeat persuasion with which i had tackled the first section, that had basically evaporated on my acquiescing to 
use a stupid as f*** data structure, leaving me feeling annoyed and just shit all round. Was also a massive WASTE OF TIME

YEAH I WANNA SPEND 4 HOURS DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE, THEN FEELING BAD ABOUT THE WAY I DID IT, ONLY TO SEE THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING THE THING I WANTED TO DO IN THE FIRST PLACE,
BUT DIDN'T BECAUSE OF A COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY POORLY WORDED HINT?

FUCKING BOLLOCKS

So there it is. I patched up the code as best I could, feeling kind of let down because I had the answer right in front of me. I was like 'and all we need to do to access this
key is type "card['French']". But I mean, the challenge says to do that thing, or rather the hint does, so I might as well give it a go.'

I should be grateful. I AM GRATEFUL. Because I've learned that I will not blindly follow some footnote in order to attempt an anti-pattern when the solution IS RIGHT THERE
IN FRONT OF ME WHICH I AM FULLY COGNISCANT OF AND WHICH NEEDS NO EXTA BS IN ORDER TO ATTAIN

I will take a short break from coding to relax a bit. Don't wanna burn out on this sort of bullshit when I was feeling so upbeat about it earlier, fucking hint -_-
